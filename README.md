## ChickenExtensions - plenty of things, but Fabric.
ChickenExtensions is a StationLoader mod, that brings to the minecraft beta 1.7.3 new thing, such as colourful leaves, furniture and some vanilla like features!

This mod is still in development, so the first release (not alpha, beta, gamma) will be published maybe... in 2021 :)

So, you can explore the mod's core and if you want, help me! I will appreciate any help.

## Gradle setup
For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE (Eclipse, Intellij IDEA) that you are using.
